<P>
The right-hander helped the Cardinals clinch the National League
Central title as St. Louis beat Pittsburgh 7-1. Only John Smoltz
has more wins among National League pitchers.

<B>Ramon Martinez, Los Angeles</B>

</PRE>

<P>
Martinez has seven straight wins and stands 21-6 since July 8,
1995. He's a vital cog in L.A's drive to the NL West crown. The
Dodgers are 1 1/2 games ahead of the Padres, who have four games
left, including three at Chavez Ravine this weekend. Los Angeles
has five games to go.

</PRE>

<P>
San Diego's 3-4 hitters continue to provide sock in a tight division
race. They each homered Tuesday, but it wasn't enough to prevent
a 5-4, 11-inning loss to Colorado that dropped the Padres 1 1/2
games behind NL West-leading Los Angeles.

This is the long ball list for the Reds third baseman in a 6-3
win over Chicago. It's the first multi-homer game of his career
and the 15th of the year in the big leagues. Mo Vaughn connected
three times for Boston, also on Tuesday.

<P>
Boston's first baseman did his damage in a 13-8 win over Baltimore.
He also became the first Red Sox player to have 200 hits and 40
homers in one season since Jim Rice 18 years ago. The Sox are
just three games behind Baltimore for the AL wild-card spot, although
each club has only five games left.

<P>
The Texas bullpen did the job in a 7-3 win over Oakland that helped
keep the Rangers three games ahead of suddenly slumping Seattle.
The Mariners, who played later Tuesday, lost their third straight,
11-6 to California.

<B>Ray Durham, Chicago</B>

<P>
Durham's only hit of the night was a two-out, game-winning single
for the White Sox, who rallied for three runs in the last of the
ninth to edge Kansas City 3-2 and maintain a wild-card presence.
Chicago is 1 1/2 games behind runnerup leader Baltimore, with
the Sox having four games remaining and the Orioles five. Seattle
also trails the Birds by 1 1/2 in the wild-card race with six
to play.

<P>
Home run No. 47 and an RBI count up to 146 for the Indians outfielder,
who is bidding to join Babe Ruth as the only back-to-back 50-homer
players. Belle's RBI total is the most in the Majors since George
Foster drove in 149 for Cincinnati in 1977. Belle has four games
left.

<P>
The right-hander, who went to 3-0 vs. the Tigers this year in
Tuesday's 4-1 victory, takes a shot at win No. 20 on Sunday. For
now, he thinks about the chance to win the American League Cy
Young Award.

<P>
The first two Seattle hurlers went a long way toward the Mariners
losing to California 11-6. That's three straight losses for the
Mariners, who have fallen three games behind Texas atop the AL
West. Seattle also is tied with Chicago, 1 1/2 games in back of
Baltimore in the AL runnerup derby.

<B>Steve Avery, Atlanta</B>
<PRE>
<B>                             ip       h   r  er  bb  so  hr    era</B>

</PRE>

<P>
In the words of Atlanta manager Bobby Cox, &quot;Aves is just
dead.&quot; At least baseball-wise, Avery has about had it for
1996. This starting performance came in a 12-1 loss to Florida.
The left-hander, who made his third start following a two-month
stint on the disabled list, remained winless since July 1. He's
likely to start the season finale on Sunday, but his prospects
of working in the postseason are not good. None of his 32 pitches
exceeded 84 mph.
