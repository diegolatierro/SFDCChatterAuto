<P>
<B>Brady Anderson, Baltimore</B>
<PRE>
<B>                       ab  r  h rbi bb so lob   avg</B>
B Anderson cf           3  1  3  1   1  0   0  .297
</PRE>

<P>
Anderson's season ended with a record for leadoff home runs in
a season (12, eclipsing Bobby Bonds' 23-year-old mark). The blast
was his 50th of the season, breaking the Orioles' team record,
making him the second player in baseball, after Oakland's Mark
McGwire, to reach the total this season, and also breaking various
laws of physics.
<P>
<B>Pat Hentgen, Toronto</B>
<PRE>
<B>                             ip       h   r  er  bb  so  hr    era</B>
Hentgen (W, 20-10)            7 1/3   7   1   1   1   4   1   3.22
</PRE>

<P>
Hentgen had been repositioned in the Blue Jays' rotation for the
chance to win 20 games, and he finished one of the best pitching
seasons in Blue Jays history in a 4-1 victory over Baltimore.
Hentgen became the second Toronto pitcher to win 20 (following
Jack Morris in 1992) and put forth his last good argument for
the Cy Young Award.
<P>
<B>Brian Banks, Milwaukee</B>
<PRE>
<B>                       ab  r  h rbi bb so lob   avg</B>
B Banks 1b              4  2  3  2   1  1   0  .571
</PRE>

<P>
Banks hit his first major league home run and second double as
the Brewers beat Detroit 7-5 in 10 innings.
<P>
<B>Tony Clark, Detroit</B>
<PRE>
<B>                       ab  r  h rbi bb so lob   avg</B>
To Clark 1b             4  2  2  3   0  0   0  .250
</PRE>

<P>
Clark hit a pair of home runs for the Tigers, giving him 27 for
the season.
<P>
<B>Paul Molitor, Minnesota</B>
<PRE>
<B>                       ab  r  h rbi bb so lob   avg</B>
Molitor dh              5  1  3  1   0  1   1  .341
</PRE>

<P>
Molitor finished his historic season with a great day and a game-winning
hit; his single in the bottom of the 10th scored Chuck Knoblauch
to give the Twins a 5-4 victory. Molitor finished the season with
a major league-leading 228 hits.
<P>
<B>Matt Stairs, Oakland</B>

Stairs lf               0  1  0  0   3  0   0  .277
</PRE>

<P>
The season closes with a great freak-show batting line.

<B>Ricky Otero, Philadelphia</B>
<PRE>
<B>                       ab  r  h rbi bb so lob   avg</B>
Otero cf                4  2  3  5   1  1   0  .273
</PRE>

<P>
Otero singled three times for one of his best games of the season.
The Phillies beat New York 9-5.
<P>
<B>Bob Tewksbury, San Diego</B>
<PRE>
<B>                             ip       h   r  er  bb  so  hr    era</B>
Tewksbury                     7       3   0   0   0   5   0   4.31
</PRE>

<P>
Off the scrap heap and into the biggest start of the season -
well, sort of, considering the Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers
were both in the playoffs. Still, Tewksbury's pitching helped
San Diego finish an improbable three-game series sweep to yank
the Dodgers out of the NL West lead. The Padres won their second
division title.
<P>
<B>Barry Larkin, Cincinnati</B>
<PRE>
<B>                       ab  r  h rbi bb so lob   avg</B>
Larkin ss               4  2  2  3   0  0   1  .298
</PRE>

<P>
Larkin hit two homers in a 6-3 victoy over St. Louis to finish
with a career-high 33, plus 89 RBI.
<P>
<B>Andres Galarraga, Colorado</B>
<PRE>
<B>                       ab  r  h rbi bb so lob   avg</B>
Galarraga 1b            5  3  3  3   0  1   1  .304
</PRE>

<P>
Another monster season for the Big Cat, who hit his NL-leading
47th home run.

<B>Jeff Cirillo, Milwaukee</B>
<PRE>
<B>                       ab  r  h rbi bb so lob   avg</B>
Cirillo 2b-3b           6  0  1  1   0  2   9  .325
</PRE>

<P>
That will be something to think about in the offseason.

<P>
<B>Marc Valdes, Florida</B>
<PRE>
<B>                             ip       h   r  er  bb  so  hr    era</B>
Valdes (BS, 1)                3       6   3   2   1   1   0   4.81
</PRE>

<P>
Valdes was roughed up enough to cost the Marlins a chance for
their first .500 season. He gave up a 2-1 lead in the sixth inning
and a 4-2 lead in the eighth, both times letting the Houston Astros
tie the score. Houston won 5-4 in 10 innings.
<P>
<B>Jay Canizaro, San Francisco</B>
<PRE>
<B>                       ab  r  h rbi bb so lob   avg</B>
Canizaro 2b             4  0  0  0   0  2   7  .200
</PRE>

<P>
An empty day at the plate for Robby Thompson's possible replacement
at second base.
