    <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;">When we looked at the options for our journey from NYC to Boston, there were the usual forms including: rental car, bus and airplane.&nbsp; However, the last and least likely in our minds was Amtrak.
      &nbsp; After comparing time, comfort and price, we settled on taking the Northeast Regional up to Boston.&nbsp; It was particularly even more attractive since our hotel in NYC was a block away from Penn Station and our hotel in Boston was a
      short 8-minute walk from South Station.&nbsp; Arriving relaxed and refreshed, we quickly made our way for some lobster rolls at Luke's Lobster.

    <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;">Yes, we were aware than they have locations everywhere including NYC (where we just arrived from).&nbsp; However, we saved our visit to the one in Boston on Exeter Street.&nbsp; Viv and I had only one
      thing on our minds and yes, it was kid-friendly...&nbsp; with <b>Noah's Ark</b> consisting one each of a Shrimp Roll, Crab Roll and Lobster Roll (split in half to share).&nbsp; Within the soft and nicely toasted buttered roll, the ingredients were
      plentiful and well-prepared.&nbsp; I found the crab to be fluffy and full of moisture (not wet though) which meant there were no dry pieces.&nbsp; There was a natural sweetness as well as an appealing brininess.&nbsp; As for the lobster, I got big
      chunks of meat that had a firm rebound while still buttery.&nbsp; Again, the meat was flavorful with a bounty of sweetness and a balancing amount of saltiness.&nbsp; We also got 4 Jonah Crab Claws which were sweet and bouncy in texture.

          My son had the <b>Shrimp Roll</b> and it was bursting with filling.&nbsp; Unlike the version that contains mayo and some form of veg such as celery, this was all shrimp that was buttery and fresh.&nbsp; I liked natural sweetness aided by the
          sprinkle of seasoning on top.&nbsp; My daughter had to try the <b>Clam Chowder</b> and it was fantastic.&nbsp; Briny and full of clam juice, the broth was flavorful and sweet.&nbsp; It wasn't overly creamy, yet not light either.&nbsp;
          There was a tonne of ingredients including tender potatoes and tender clams.
