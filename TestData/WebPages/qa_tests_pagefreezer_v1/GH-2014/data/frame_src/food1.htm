    <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">One of the things we had planned to do while in Boston was the popular Freedom Trail.&nbsp; It consists of signif
      <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">icant </span>
      historical sights and spots along a 2.5 mile stretch of Downtown Boston.&nbsp; It is marked by a narrow brick line along the sidewalks it snakes down.&nbsp; So it was only natural to eat lunch somewhere
      along the trail right?&nbsp; That brought us to Sam LaGrassa's (self-proclaimed world's #1 sandwiches).&nbsp; Featured on the Food Network, the place sports fresh made-to-order sammies with house-made ingredients.

      <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">With that in mind, Viv decided to try their
        <b>Pastrami Corned Beef Combo</b> as an unofficial comparison to the one we had at Carnegie Deli (yes, different city, we know).&nbsp; Well, the one here won hands down.&nbsp;
        The meats were better prepared in our opinion as the corned beef was buttery soft and well-spiced while the pastrami was even more flavourful.&nbsp; The addition of Swiss Cheese,
        Russian dressing and tangy coleslaw added extra layers of Earthiness, salt, creaminess and zip.&nbsp; On the other hand, the whole thing was wet which made the bottom slice of light rye disintegrate.&nbsp;
        My son opted for the <b>Chicken Parmigiana</b> with marinara sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil.&nbsp; This was decent with a soft chicken breast (a little too soft and the coating was mushy) smothered in a tangy sauce.&nbsp;
        I would've liked to see more basil though.
